# Deployment Guide

In phase 4, the focus is on tasks that involve setting up and implementing Pilot Tests, as well as the final rollout of &bookme – Scheduler in the company.

## Pilot

You probably already have established pilot strategies in the area, which is why these should be used, as &bookme – Scheduler should be considered another new feature.

However, for the Pilot test itself, we recommend that you select (as a minimum):
- 2-3 departments (with premises) with good geographical spread
- 8-10 advisors + managers
who can help test and provide feedback on the solution.

Input and experiences from the Pilot Test provide important insights for the later rollout, and provide the opportunity to use the pilot participants as ambassadors.

## Full deployment
You probably already have established procedures for rolling out new features, so these should be used.
