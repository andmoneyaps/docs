#Trouble shooting

The current reporting functionality does not display the count of PowerPoint and PDF files generated within the Management UI.
This limitation is due to the bank's continued use of legacy credentials.

To resolve this issue, the bank should be transitioned to use the latest set of credentials configured in Salesforce.
This update will enable accurate tracking and reporting of document generation activities in the Management UI.
