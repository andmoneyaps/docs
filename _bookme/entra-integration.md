# Microsoft Entra Integration

## Overview

BookMe integrates with Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD) to provide secure authentication and authorization. This document outlines the key components and configurations of this integration.

## App Registrations

BookMe uses multiple app registrations to handle different aspects of the platform:

### Multi-Tenant App Registrations

These app registrations are designed to work across different customer tenants:

#### BookingPlatform Management UI
- Primary purpose: Handles browser-based login flows
- Capabilities: Requests access tokens for API access
- Use case: User authentication and authorization

#### BookingPlatform Management API
- Exposes API permission scopes
- Defines app roles:
  - Admin
  - Configurator
  - Manager
  - Employee
  - Customer
- Note: Does not support direct login (client credentials flow disabled)

### Single-Tenant App Registrations

These app registrations exist within the BookMe tenant:

#### BookMe API System Integration
- Exposes API permission scopes
- Includes System app role
- Used for system-level integrations

#### Bank-Specific System Integration
For each bank customer:
- Unique client ID and secret
- Supports client credentials OAuth flow
- Automatically receives System app role
- **Important**: Client secrets expire after 2 years and must be renewed

## Token Management

### Multi-Tenant Applications
- Tokens include the customer's Entra Tenant as issuer (iss claim)
- Requires mapping between Entra Tenant ID and BookMe BankId in the organization database
- Supports multiple BankId mappings per tenant
  - Users can select their active bank context in the Management UI

### Single-Tenant Applications
- Uses 'authorized party' (azp claim) for BankId mapping
- Requires configuration in bp_organizations_db database
- ClientId must be registered in the BankClients table

## Security Considerations

### Client Secret Management
- Default expiration: 2 years from creation
- Regular monitoring required
- Plan secret rotation before expiration
- Communicate new secrets to customers in advance

### Administrator Requirements
- Installing app registrations requires:
  - Cloud Application Administrator role, or
  - Application Administrator role

### Permission Management
- Customer tenant administrators can:
  - Map users/groups to app roles
  - Manage enterprise applications
  - Configure access controls

## Best Practices

1. **Tenant Mapping**
   - Always configure proper tenant-to-bank mappings
   - Verify database configurations before deployment

2. **Access Control**
   - Use appropriate app roles for user permissions
   - Regularly review role assignments

3. **Secret Management**
   - Monitor client secret expiration dates
   - Plan rotations well in advance
   - Maintain secure communication channels for secret distribution

4. **Permission Scopes**
   - Request minimal necessary permissions
   - Avoid unnecessary admin consent requirements
   - Use basic Microsoft Graph API scopes when possible
