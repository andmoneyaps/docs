# Bulk Slide Selection

When building presentations, you can quickly select or deselect multiple slides at once using the bulk selection feature. This saves time when working with templates that contain many slides.

## What is Bulk Slide Selection?

Bulk slide selection allows you to select or deselect all slides in a section or subsection with a single click, instead of clicking each slide individually.

This is particularly useful when:
- You want to include all slides from a specific category
- You need to quickly clear your selection and start over
- You're working with templates that have many slides per section

## How to Use Bulk Slide Selection

### Selecting All Slides in a Section

When you open a slide category (e.g., "Introduction" or "Products"), you'll see two buttons at the top of the modal:

- **Vælg alle** (Select All) — Selects all slides in the current section
- **Fravælg alle** (Deselect All) — Removes all slides in the current section from your selection

> These buttons affect all slides visible in the modal, across all subsections.

### Selecting All Slides in a Subsection

Each subsection within the modal has its own pair of selection buttons next to the subsection heading. Use these to select or deselect only the slides within that specific subsection.

This gives you fine-grained control — for example, you might select all "Bonds" slides but only specific "Shares" slides.

## Combining Bulk and Individual Selection

Bulk selection works seamlessly with individual slide selection:

1. Use **Vælg alle** to select all slides in a section
2. Click individual slides to deselect the ones you don't need
3. Or start with **Fravælg alle** to clear everything, then pick specific slides

The selection buttons are smart — they only act on slides that aren't already in the desired state. Clicking "Select All" when some slides are already selected will add the remaining slides without affecting your existing selection.

## Visual Feedback

Selected slides are highlighted with a green border, making it easy to see your current selection at a glance.

## Best Practices

- **Start broad, then refine** — Select all slides in a section, then deselect the ones you don't need
- **Use subsection buttons for precision** — When you only need slides from specific subsections
- **Review before closing** — Check your selection before closing the modal to ensure you have the right slides

> Your selection is automatically saved when you close the modal. If you change your mind, you can always reopen the section and adjust your selection.
