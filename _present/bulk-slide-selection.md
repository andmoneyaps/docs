# Bulk Slide Selection

Select or deselect multiple slides at once when building presentations.

## Section-Level Selection

When you open a slide category, you'll see two buttons at the top of the modal:

- **Vælg alle** — Selects all slides in the current section
- **Fravælg alle** — Deselects all slides in the current section

## Subsection-Level Selection

Each subsection has its own selection buttons next to the heading, allowing you to select or deselect slides within that specific subsection only.

## Tips

- Start with "Vælg alle" then deselect individual slides you don't need
- Use subsection buttons when you only need slides from specific subsections
- Selected slides are highlighted with a green border
