# Validation Tool - Master Template

The Present validation tool allows you to test and validate your master templates before uploading them in Present.

This tool helps you to identify any issues with your templates before they are uploaded to Present. It performs several checks to ensure your templates will work correctly in the system.

## Key Features

- Validates tag syntax and formatting
- Checks for missing data in charts
- Identifies incorrect tag usage
- Verifies section and slide naming conventions
- Reports template structure issues

## Using the Validation Tool

1. Access the validation tool from the Present app interface
2. Click the validate button to start the validation process
3. Select your template file for validation
4. Review the validation results

![Validate Template](../../assets/images/present/validate_template.png){width="600"}

![Validation Results](../../assets/images/present/validation_results.png){width="600"}

## Validation Results

The tool provides three levels of feedback:

- **Info**: General information about the template
- **Warnings**: Potential issues that may affect functionality
- **Errors**: Critical issues that must be fixed before upload
