# Project management &amp; quality assurance

The Service Providers project management for implementation spans over several key areas, focusing on ensuring the product aligns with business needs, delivers value, and meets quality standards. The below list are some of the activities that we conduct before and during the implementation:

## 1. Requirement gathering and stakeholder alignment (typically during contracting)
- Define customer goals:
  What does the customer seek to achieve with the product (e.g., cost savings, improved customer experience, revenue generation)?

- Identify stakeholders
  Which internal teams are to be a part of project and collaborate (e.g., marketing, operations) and external partners to ensure all voices are heard?

- Develop user stories or use cases:
  In case additional features are to be introduced during implementation, we work with product managers and technical teams to translate business requirements into actionable user stories / use cases.

- Sign-off on scope:
  Review and approve the project scope, ensuring it aligns with strategic priorities across the organization.

## 2. Project planning and oversight
- Resource allocation:
  We ensure the right people and tools are available for project execution.

- Timeline management:
  Work with project & product managers to ensure realistic timelines and adherence to the schedule.

- Risk Assessment:
  Identify potential risks (e.g., delays, resource shortages) and work on mitigation strategies.

## 3. Communication and coordination
- Communication:
  We make sure that there is a bridge between technical teams and business stakeholders, ensuring alignment of needs and understanding.

- Facilitate feedback:
  We regularly review progress and provide input during standups, sprint reviews, or milestone meetings in technical- and business teams.

- Manage change requests:
  Evaluate and prioritize change requests based on business impact and feasibility.

## 4. Quality assurance

- Define quality standards:
  We collaborate with internal QA teams to set benchmarks for functionality, usability, and performance.

- Internal acceptance testing (IAT):
  In addition to our automated testing, we conduct manual internal acceptance testing in the product management team before releasing into production, to validate that the product meets business needs and defined use cases and user stories

- Monitor testing phases:
  We review reports from unit testing, integration testing, and system testing to identify critical issues.

- Drive continuous improvement:
  Provide feedback on process gaps or opportunities for enhancing quality practices or unique business needs not covered by deliveries.

- Backlog
  Create and maintain a backlog with future requirements and align with your provider to ensure documentation of future business needs and align expected deliveries.

## 5. Launch and post-implementation support

- Prepare for launch:
  Align with teams on go-to-market strategies, training materials, and rollout plans.

- Post-launch monitoring:
  Review early user feedback and address defects or enhancements.

## 6. Documentation and reporting

- Maintain documentation:
  We ensure thorough documentation of requirements, decisions, and changes throughout the project. &money gives access to documentation, but it will mostly contain technical information.

- Provide reports to stakeholders:
  We deliver regular updates on progress, risks, and results to the designated point-of-contacts.

- Contribute to lessons learned:
  Participate in retrospectives to identify what worked well and areas for improvement. This is highly prioritized by &money in our effort to constantly involve and improve our products and processes.
