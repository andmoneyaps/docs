# Test &amp; validation

Test and validation involve comprehensive procedures aimed at ensuring that all integrations are properly established and that system configurations align with the intended use. This process includes:
- Integration Testing:

  This step confirms that different systems and modules communicate seamlessly and that data exchanges occur as expected. It involves testing integrations between the &money backend and integration points, such as Entra and the CRM System ensuring smooth operation.
- Configuration Validation:

  This step verifies that all system settings and configurations match the specifications and requirements outlined during the setting up phase. It ensures that the system is set up correctly to support the business processes and user needs. This is an activity requiring close coordination between &money and customer domain and technical experts
- By meticulously performing these tests and validations, we ensure that the new system is robust, reliable, and ready for deployment without any unforeseen issues or challenges.
