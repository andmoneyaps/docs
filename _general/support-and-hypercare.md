# Support 

## Support
Support Tickets need to be filled out by Customer via the support system provided by Service Provider.

### SLA

Customer has access to the Service Provider's support system (support tickets).

Operating hours: 
- Danish business days (Monday-Friday, excluding public holidays and bank holidays) 08:00-16:00.

Extraordinary service windows may occur within the operating hours, if deemed necessary to ensure the security or stability of the Applications (e.g. in case of security incidents, critical updates/patches etc.). Service Provider will endeavor to provide notice of such extraordinary service windows.

Incident management:

| Ticket priorities  | Definition of usage | SLA (first response) |
|--------------------| ------- |----------------------|
| Highest (critical) | All users affected – risk of data loss | 1 business hour      |
| High (high)        | Some users affected – risk of data loss | 4 business hours     |
| Medium (default)   | Some users affected – no data loss | 8 business hours     |
| Low (default)      | Single user affected | 12 business hours    |
| Lowest | Inquiry | 16 business hours    |


Resolution time depends on the incident; Service Provider takes a standardized criticality approach towards incident resolution.
