## General Overview

**Present** is designed to allow company employees to easily create meeting presentations directly within the CRM system, ensuring consistent, on-brand customer communication.

---

## How to Use Present

### Admin/Customer Responsible

Before employees can use Present in the CRM system, setup is required via &money's Management UI.

üîó [Go to Management UI](https://management.andmoney.dk)

This guide assumes that the user has been granted **Admin access** to the Management UI by their Entra administrator, and that the customer uses **Salesforce** as their CRM.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Screenshots are examples only and may not reflect the current CVI design.

#### 1. Open the Management UI

Access: [https://management.andmoney.dk](https://management.andmoney.dk)

#### 2. Configure Customer Types

- In the left menu, go to `BookMe > Meeting Setup > Customer Types`
- Create or add customer types.
- Customer types used specifically for Present can be configured under `BookMe > Meeting Setup > Meeting configuration` and set as unavailable for regular meeting bookings.

#### 3. Go to Present Setup

- In the left menu, click `Present > Setup`.

#### 4. Upload Master templates

- Upload master templates for each customer type.
- Multiple master templaes can be uploaded per type to avoid oversized master template files.

> ‚úÖ Master templates (Presentations) are automatically validated during upload.  
> üìñ [Read more about validation](https://andmoneyaps.github.io/docs/present/Validation-tool-Master-template/)

#### 5. Configure Master templates

Follow these setup guides before employees begin using Present:

- [Present Usage Guide](https://andmoneyaps.github.io/docs/present/Present-Usage/)
- [Tag Mapping Guide](https://andmoneyaps.github.io/docs/present/tag-mapping/)

Once this is complete, Present is ready for use in Salesforce. Employees will access Present from a meeting event within a customer account.
