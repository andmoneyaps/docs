# Playbooks

## Introduction

Playbooks are powerful automation workflows in the andMoney platform that orchestrate complex business processes by connecting various system components. They enable automated data processing, integration with AI capabilities, and seamless CRM interactions through a visual block-based configuration system.

## Key Concepts

### What are Playbooks?

Playbooks are configurable workflows that:
- Automate complex business processes
- Connect different system components (AI, Entity Patterns, Templates)
- Transform and process data between various services
- React to specific triggers (Portal meetings, Summary events)
- Enable sophisticated data orchestration without code

### Use Cases

Playbooks are particularly valuable for:
- **Meeting Automation**: Automatically process meeting data, generate summaries, and update CRM records
- **Customer Intelligence**: Aggregate customer data from multiple sources and generate insights
- **Document Generation**: Create personalized documents based on meeting outcomes
- **Data Synchronization**: Keep CRM data synchronized with meeting activities
- **Workflow Automation**: Automate multi-step business processes

## Architecture Overview

### System Integration

Playbooks integrate with multiple platform components:

```
┌─────────────┐     ┌──────────────┐     ┌─────────────┐
│   Trigger   │────▶│   Playbook   │────▶│   Output    │
│   (Portal)  │     │   Executor   │     │  (Results)  │
└─────────────┘     └──────────────┘     └─────────────┘
                            │
                ┌───────────┼───────────┐
                ▼           ▼           ▼
        ┌──────────┐ ┌──────────┐ ┌──────────┐
        │    AI    │ │  Entity  │ │ Template │
        │          │ │ Patterns │ │  Engine  │
        └──────────┘ └──────────┘ └──────────┘
```

### Execution Flow

1. **Trigger Activation**: A trigger event (e.g., Portal meeting creation) initiates the playbook
2. **Block Execution**: Blocks execute sequentially based on their order and relations
3. **Data Transformation**: Data flows between blocks through configured transformations
4. **Output Generation**: Final blocks produce results (documents, CRM updates, notifications)

## Block Types

Playbooks consist of different block types, each serving a specific purpose:

### 1. Trigger Block
- **Purpose**: Initiates playbook execution
- **Types**:
  - **Portal**: Triggered by portal meeting events
  - **Summary**: Triggered by summary generation events
- **Configuration**: Requires trigger type selection
- **Required**: Every playbook must have exactly one trigger block

### 2. AI Block
- **Purpose**: Integrates AI/ML capabilities
- **Function**: Executes AI capabilities for intelligent processing
- **Configuration**: Capability ID (identifies the specific AI function)
- **Use Cases**: Text analysis, summarization, entity extraction, sentiment analysis

### 3. EntityPatternRead block
- **Purpose**: Retrieves data from CRM systems
- **Function**: Fetches entity data based on configured patterns
- **Configuration**: Entity Pattern ID
- **Output**: Structured CRM data

### 4. Output Block
- **Purpose**: Produces playbook results
- **Function**: Formats and delivers final outputs
- **Configuration**: Output format // TODO
- **Use Cases**: What the playbook should output

## Block Relations and Transformations

### Understanding Relations

Relations define how data flows between blocks. Each block can only configure its input relations - it cannot directly configure outputs to other blocks.

- **Input Relations**: Define what data a block receives from previous blocks
- **Source Block ID**: References a block that executes before the current block
- **Source Field**: Specifies which output field from the source block to use
- **Destination Field**: Defines where the data is mapped in the current block's input

### Editing Blocks and Adding Relations

To configure block relations and transformations:

1. **Select a Block**: Choose a block with both type and value configured
2. **Access Edit Mode**: Click the edit button on the block
3. **Use the Relation Builder**:
   - Click "Add Input Relation" to open the Relation Builder
   - Navigate through the source block's output structure
   - Build the field path using the interactive interface
   - Handle arrays with "First" or "All" selection
   - The builder generates the correct dot-notation path
4. **Configure the Relation**:
   - Source Block: Selected from previous blocks
   - Source Field: Path generated by the Relation Builder
   - Destination Field: Where to map in current block
   - Transformation: Optional data modification
5. **Data Flow**: The block will receive data from configured source blocks and process it according to its type

The Relation Builder provides an intuitive way to navigate complex data structures and create precise field mappings without manually writing paths. See the [Relation Builder Guide](playbooks-relation-builder.md) for detailed information.

### Transformation Types

Playbooks support several transformation operations:

#### 1. Identity Transformation
- **Purpose**: Passes data through unchanged
- **Use Case**: Direct field mapping

#### 2. Project Transformation
- **Purpose**: Selects specific fields from complex objects
- **Configuration**: Field paths to extract
- **Example**: Extract `customer.name` from a complex customer object

#### 3. Extract Transformation
- **Purpose**: Extracts values from nested structures
- **Configuration**: Path to the desired value
- **Use Case**: Get specific attributes from JSON responses

#### 4. Join Transformation
- **Purpose**: Combines multiple data sources
- **Configuration**: Join keys and merge strategy
- **Use Case**: Merge customer data from different sources

#### 5. Split Transformation
- **Purpose**: Divides data into multiple outputs
- **Configuration**: Split criteria or patterns
- **Use Case**: Separate array elements or parse structured text

## Data Flow Example

Here's how data flows through a typical meeting playbook:

```
1. Trigger (Portal Meeting)
   ↓ [meeting_id, participants]
2. EntityPatternRead (Fetch Customer)
   ↓ [customer_data, meeting_id]
3. AI (Generate Summary)
   ↓ [summary_text, action_items]
4. Output (Return Results)
```

## Integration with Platform Services

### AI Integration
- Provides AI capabilities for intelligent data processing
- Capabilities are identified by unique IDs
- Supports various AI functions (NLP, summarization, classification)
- Handles structured and unstructured data

### Entity Pattern Integration
- Connects to CRM systems (Salesforce, Dynamics)
- Provides CRUD operations on business entities
- Supports complex queries and filters
- Maintains data consistency across systems

### Portal Integration
- Triggers playbooks based on meeting events
- Provides meeting context and metadata
- Enables automated meeting workflows
- Supports real-time and batch processing

## Best Practices

### Design Principles

1. **Keep It Simple**: Start with simple playbooks and add complexity gradually
2. **Modular Design**: Create reusable block configurations
3. **Error Handling**: Plan for failure scenarios and edge cases
4. **Performance**: Consider data volumes and processing times
5. **Testing**: Test playbooks thoroughly before production deployment

### Naming Conventions

- Use descriptive names for playbooks and blocks
- Follow a consistent naming pattern
- Include the purpose in the name (e.g., "Customer Meeting Summary Playbook")
- Use clear block names that describe their function

### Configuration Guidelines

1. **Validate Inputs**: Ensure all required fields are configured
2. **Map Fields Carefully**: Verify source and destination field mappings
3. **Test Transformations**: Validate data transformations with sample data
4. **Document Complex Logic**: Add descriptions to complex configurations
5. **Version Control**: Track playbook changes and maintain versions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Trigger Not Firing**
   - Verify trigger type configuration
   - Check event source connectivity
   - Review trigger conditions

2. **Data Not Flowing Between Blocks**
   - Verify block relations are configured
   - Check field mappings
   - Validate transformation configurations

3. **Entity Pattern Errors**
   - Confirm Entity Pattern ID is valid
   - Verify CRM connectivity
   - Check entity permissions

4. **AI Processing Failures**
   - Validate Capability ID
   - Check input data format
   - Review capability requirements
