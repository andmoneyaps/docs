# License Management

Present requires proper license management in your Salesforce org to ensure users have the appropriate access. This includes managing Managed Package Licenses (MPLs) and user permissions.

For detailed information on how to manage Present Licenses in Salesforce, please refer to the [official Salesforce documentation on MPL verification](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=ind.comms_Verify_Your_MPLs.htm&type=5).

> **Note:** Make sure to verify that each user who needs to use Present has been assigned the appropriate license and permission sets.
