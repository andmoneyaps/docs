# Key Concepts

This section explains the main building blocks of a booking portal from a user's perspective.

- **Portals**: The entry point for a booking experience. Each portal is a self-contained booking flow.

- **Customer Categories**: A way to group customers to provide them with tailored options (e.g., "Private Customers" vs. "Business Clients").

- **Meeting Themes**: The purpose of the meeting (e.g., "Mortgage Consultation," "Investment Planning"). The available themes can change based on the selected Customer Category.

- **Custom Fields**: For certain meeting themes, the system can ask for specific information upfront to help the advisor prepare for the meeting.
